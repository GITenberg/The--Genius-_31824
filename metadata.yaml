description: "Mad scientist (also mad doctor or mad professor) is a caricature of\
  \ a scientist who is described as \"mad\" or \"insane\" owing to a combination of\
  \ unusual or unsettling personality traits and the unabashedly ambitious, taboo\
  \ and/or hubristic nature of their experiments. As a motif in fiction, the mad scientist\
  \ may be villainous (evil genius) or antagonistic, benign or neutral; may be insane,\
  \ eccentric, or clumsy; and often works with fictional technology or fails to recognize\
  \ or value common human objections to attempting to play God. Some may have benevolent\
  \ or good-spirited intentions, even if their actions are dangerous or questionable,\
  \ which can make them accidental villains.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
